Hi!


I hope that you are doing well. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from University of Winnipeg
who has a passion for learning everything related to game development. 

I am fairly experienced in using Java, C++, C, Python, Lua, HTML and JavaScript. 

I am currently putting time into learning C#, Unity, Unreal Engine and kubernetes.

While I do work on programs and codes that I want to proudly display on my github, I will continue to update this file. 

Thank you to all those who took time to read this. I hope that you find something interesting here.
