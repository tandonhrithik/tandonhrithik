Hi!


I hope that you are doing well. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from University of Winnipeg
who has a passion for learning everything related to game development. 

I am fairly experienced in using Java, C++, C, Python, Lua, HTML and JavaScript. 

I am currently putting time into learning C#, Unity, Unreal Engine and kubernetes.

My current projects: 
- Developing a third person game in unity that I plan on porting on Android devices.
- Refining my lua and C++ to start working on a C++ based project in Unreal Engine that uses embedded lua scripts

Thank you to all those who took time to read this. I hope that you find something interesting here.
