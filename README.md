Welcome to my Github profile!

As a web developer with experience in a range of programming languages, including C, C#, C++, Java, Python, and PHP, I enjoy creating innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital world. My passion for coding extends beyond just web development, as I have also published a simple memory card game on itch.io.

During my last job, I gained experience working with .NET Framework, which has helped me to understand the importance of creating efficient and optimized code. I am also proficient in various frameworks and libraries such as Unity, Angular, React API, JQuery, and NodeJS, enabling me to create dynamic and responsive web applications.

I believe that programming should be enjoyable and engaging since it offers an unfathomable amount of freedom to the developers. That's why I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and create fun and interesting projects that showcase my creativity and technical expertise.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my profile, and I hope that you have a lovely day.
