Hi!


I hope that you are doing well. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from University of Winnipeg
who has a passion for learning everything related to game development. 

I am fairly experienced in using Java, C++, C, Python, Lua, HTML and JavaScript. 

I am currently putting time into learning C#, Unity, Unreal Engine and kubernetes.

Finished projects:
- A Memory Card game built using unity. Can be played on itch.io at https://htd77.itch.io/simple-memory-game

My current projects: 
- Developing a first person game in Unreal Engine using C++ and blender.
- Learning to optimize code using DirectX 11 and its library.

Thank you to all those who took time to read this. I hope that you find something interesting here.
